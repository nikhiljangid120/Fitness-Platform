      "For a beginner-friendly workout, try this routine:\n\n• 3 sets of 10 squats\n• 3 sets of 5-10 push-ups (on knees if needed)\n• 3 sets of 10 lunges per leg\n• 30-second plank\n\nRest 60 seconds between exercises.",

      "To build muscle, focus on compound movements:\n\n• 4 sets of 8-12 squats\n• 4 sets of 8-12 bench press or push-ups\n• 4 sets of 8-12 rows\n• 3 sets of 10-15 lunges\n\nRest 90 seconds between sets for optimal muscle growth.",
